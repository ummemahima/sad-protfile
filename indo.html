        <h3>Sad hurts but it's a healthy feeling.</h3>
        <p>Sadness is one of the deepest emotions that a person can feel. It can tear you apart, and everything around you will feel like it’s falling apart. But yet, you will be at a stage where you will not express your feelings in words.</p>

            <p>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking.</p>

            <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>
